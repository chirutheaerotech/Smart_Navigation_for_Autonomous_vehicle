# Smart_Navigation_for_Autonomous_vehicle
Developed an innovative mapping project as an alternative to Google Maps, incorporating the A* algorithm for enhanced pathfinding efficiency.
Replaced the traditional Dijkstra Algorithm with A* Algorithm, leveraging intelligent heuristics to significantly reduce time complexity and improve
route optimization.
